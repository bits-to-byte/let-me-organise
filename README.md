### Description 

Let's Launch will help you to organize your community whether it has 5 members, 10 members, or n members :P. Here the community can be anything, for example - a small college club, a big college fest team, a YouTube community, or a social media influencer, etc etc etc :sunglasses:. So now no more headache to organize your community. Just follow a simple formula :pencil2: CREATE + ONBOARD + START. Ok, one more left ENJOY :grin:

As we know organizing a community is very hard, you need to manage every member and activities whatever the admin wants to conduct. Not only this creating a whole new platform and a communication medium is way too hard. For example, if you are a YouTuber then it's very hard for you to manage a new platform to interact with your community as well as for selling your product like your own merchandise. 

Similarly, let's see another example, let's say you are managing a college event organizing club, and let's assume no one in your team knows how to code, then no problem use our tool -> sit -> enjoy :D. It will let you create roles, channels, and whatever you need to manage your team.

Our tool comes with two platforms - 
1. A Website: **Let's Launch**
2. A Discord bot: **Robinhood**

Website will help you to start your community where you can manage your community profile page, selling services like merchandise, event tickets, books, etc. 

The Discord bot will help you to manage the members in your community server, for example, you can onboard new members, assign a role, create a channel, manage core team members, etc.

Let's see both the platforms in the Features section.....

### :star: Features

4. Classify your organization(type can be YouTube, business, shop, etc) to increase the reach.

**Discord Bot -**

We'll see the demo in the example workflow.

### âš¡Example Workflow 

Let's assume my friend Sourav has a YouTube Gaming streaming channel named **Sourav's gaming room** :video_game:. Let's assume he has 5K subscribers and now he wants to grow more. So for this, he needs to increase community engagement. But Sourav doesn't know any coding :confounded: so that he could create a platform for himself and also he found creating a new discord and then adding a lil hectic task. 
Now some **Avengers** :sunglasses: came to help him - the **Team Bits2Byte**. They told him to use this platform to organize everything, from an online showcase platform to a communication channel. 
So Sourav decide to use this - 
- He created a community called as **Sourav gaming room** through our **website**. He added all the necessary details to increase his social reach. 
- Now he is the registered **admin** of Sourav gaming room in Discord i.e. the **admin role** in Discord.
- Now because of his descent number of subscribers he made an announcement that created an online community. Hurray :see_no_evil: now others can go to the website and join the discord from there and then the real game starts.
-  Through this server, he can engage with his community. Not only this but he can also organize some mini-tournaments, subscribers can play among each other, etc etc. This complete package will make them organize a party :flashlight: :stars: :notes: :guitar:.

Let's assume a gaming fan Prakhar Agrawal joined his server let's what he need to do -
